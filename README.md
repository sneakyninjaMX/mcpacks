This repository should contain most of my (and probably SlimeShulker's) resource packs.
You should be able to find most versions of the packs including betas, these are ordered by the pack version and not the minecraft version they are intended for.
If the pack has a B in the name it is either a beta or testing version of the pack, and will probably have bugs, all packs should work from 1.21 onwards and are intended for Minecraft Bedrock Edition.
